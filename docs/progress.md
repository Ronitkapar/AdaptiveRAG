# AdaptiveRAG — Project Progress

## Project

AdaptiveRAG — Query-Aware Retrieval Optimization for Efficient RAG

Core research/engineering question:

> When does a query actually need expensive retrieval, and can we automatically
> choose an appropriate retrieval strategy?

The eventual system will compare:

* Dense retrieval
* BM25 / lexical retrieval
* Hybrid retrieval
* Reranked retrieval
* Adaptive retrieval

Evaluation will consider:

* Retrieval quality
* Answer quality
* Latency
* Token usage
* Estimated cost

# Phase 1 — Corpus Foundation

Status: COMPLETE

Completed:

* 14 research papers collected
* Canonical metadata manifest
* Deterministic downloader
* PDF validation
* SHA-256 validation
* Corpus tests
* Corpus documentation
* Raw PDFs excluded from Git

The corpus covers:

* Foundational RAG
* Dense retrieval
* Sparse retrieval
* Hybrid retrieval
* Reranking
* Advanced RAG
* Adaptive retrieval

Phase 1 deliberately did not perform:

* text extraction
* chunking
* embedding
* indexing
* retrieval
* generation

# Phase 2 — Fixed Dense-RAG Baseline

Status:

* Implementation: COMPLETE
* Offline validation: COMPLETE
* Live provider execution: PENDING USER-SIDE VALIDATION

Phase 2 established the fixed Dense-RAG baseline that later retrieval
strategies will be compared against.

## Implemented

### Ingestion

* PDF ingestion using `pdfplumber`
* Hierarchical Document representation
* Structure-aware element extraction
* Provenance preservation
* Heading classification and guards

### Chunking

* Structure-aware chunking
* Frozen chunking configuration
* Configurable overlap
* Hard-capped splitting
* Undersized sibling merging
* Atomic handling of tables/figures/equations where appropriate

Observed frozen corpus:

* 713 chunks
* Mean: approximately 408 tokens
* Median: approximately 447 tokens
* 106 atomic chunks
* Maximum: approximately 891 tokens

The largest chunk is intentionally retained because it is an unsplit table.

The initial chunking attempt produced excessive fragmentation and was
recalibrated before freezing the current corpus.

### Embeddings

* AICredits provider
* `text-embedding-3-large`
* Provider abstraction
* Content-addressed SQLite embedding cache

### Indexing

* Local Qdrant
* Cosine similarity
* Vector dimension validation
* Index metadata/versioning
* Compatibility handling for current Qdrant client behavior

### Retrieval

* `DenseRetriever`
* Fixed `top_k`
* Structured retrieval results
* Scores and provenance preserved
* Explicit failure semantics

### Generation

* Groq API
* Provider abstraction
* Context Builder
* Versioned prompts
* Structured `GenerationResult`
* Source/chunk IDs preserved
* Token usage and latency recorded

### Evaluation

* Independent evaluation dataset
* Retrieval metrics:

  * Recall@k
  * Precision@k
  * Hit@k
  * MRR
  * nDCG
* Generation metrics:

  * lexical F1
  * ROUGE-L
  * cached Groq judge
* Efficiency:

  * retrieval latency
  * generation latency
  * total latency
  * token usage
  * estimated cost
* Raw experiment traces
* Reproducible experiment configuration
* Experiment artifacts

### Validation

* 42 pytest tests pass
* Phase 1's 5 unittest tests pass
* Offline end-to-end smoke test passes
* Provider checks fail closed without credentials
* `.env` is ignored
* No secrets are committed
* Experiment run directories are ignored
* Guards confirm no BM25/hybrid/reranking/adaptive implementation was
  introduced during Phase 2

# Remaining Phase 2 User-Side Validation

The implementation is complete, but live provider execution still requires
the user's credentials.

Expected sequence:

```text
check_providers.py
        ↓
embed_chunks.py
        ↓
build_index.py
        ↓
run_experiment.py --name dense_baseline_v1
        ↓
ask.py
```

Live execution should confirm that the external embedding and generation
providers work correctly with the implemented system.

# Current Project State

Phase 2 is considered complete as an implementation and offline-validation
milestone.

The next development phase is:

> Phase 3 — BM25 Retrieval

Phase 3 should establish a fixed lexical retrieval baseline while preserving
the existing retrieval and evaluation architecture.

Do not implement Phase 3+ functionality until the phase is explicitly started.
